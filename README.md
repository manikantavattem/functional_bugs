## RegDroid

### Getting Started


#### Requirements

- Android SDK: API26+
- python 3.8
- We use some libraries (e.g., uiautomator2, androguard, cv2) provided by python, you can add them as prompted, for example:

```
pips install uiautomator2
```

#### Setting up

You can create an emulator before running RegDroid. See [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43275238/how-to-set-system-images-path-when-creating-an-android-avd) for how to create avd using [avdmanager](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/avdmanager).
The following sample command will help you create an emulator, which will help you to start using RegDroid quicklyï¼š

```
sdkmanager "system-images;android-26;google_apis;x86"
avdmanager create avd --force --name Android8.0 --package 'system-images;android-26;google_apis;x86' --abi google_apis/x86 --sdcard 512M --device "pixel_xl"
```

Next, you can start two identical emulators and assign their port numbers with the following commands:

```
emulator -avd Android8.0 -read-only -port 5554
emulator -avd Android8.0 -read-only -port 5556
```

#### Run

If you have downloaded our project and configured the environment, you only need to enter ``download_path/tool/RegDroid`` to execute our sample app with the following command:

```
python3 start.py -app_path ./App/AmazeFileManager-3.7.1.apk -emulator_path  path_to_emulator -app_path ./App/AmazeFileManager-3.7.2.apk  -append_device emulator-5554 -append_device emulator-5556 -output  3.7.1-3.7.2  -testcase_count 1 -event_num 20
```

Here,

``-app_path``: the file path of APK

``-emulator_path ``: the path to the emulator

``-append_device``: the serial number of devices used in the test, which can be obtained by executing "adb devices" in the terminal.

``-output``: the output directory under /Tool/Output/app_package_name/

``-testcase_count`` The number of rounds that you want to test.

``-event_num`` The number of events in per round of test.
